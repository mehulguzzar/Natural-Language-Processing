Twitter Sentiment Analysis implemented as part of the NLP module

The power of social media in spreading a message cannot be discounted for in today's world. What may begin as a single statement or post by an individual could be a trending topic within a matter of hours, thanks to the global connectivity made easy by social media platforms

For the most part of it, social media is the number one go-to place to ask for help or provide help to those in need, be it a personal emergency or a public health hazard like the COVID pandemic or a natural disaster. However, with the pros of social media also comes the cons of the spread of negative ideas targeted towards a specific section of the society for example, racism, hate speech, false information etc

In order to keep this under control, it would be useful to implement certain algorithms which are able to detect the polarity score of any individual or group on the social media and take appropriate action if their profile and the related content looks suspicious

Keeping the above problem statement in mind, we have implemented a few algorithms from the Natural Language Processing toolkit using Python, to analyse the content of tweets made by individuals and decide whether their account should be scrutinised further
